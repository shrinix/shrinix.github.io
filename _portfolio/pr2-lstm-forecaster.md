## Overview

The objective of this project is to understand time series analysis and prediction. 

A basic forecasting model using synthetic data is used to understand the fundamentals of time series forecasting.  The synthetic data simulates a simple financial time series with a linear trend and some random noise, mimicking a basic scenario in financial forecasting. The basic model is used to:

- Understand the structure of time series data.
- Learn how to split data appropriately for time series forecasting.
- Explore the application of linear regression in a time series context.
- Visualize and evaluate the performance of our forecasting model.

Then, more complex models are built to process real financial data, where the following concepts are explored:

- Complex feature engineering.
- Different forecasting models, including LSTM-based neural networks.
- Analysis and comparision of the performance of the models.
